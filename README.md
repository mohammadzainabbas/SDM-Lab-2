#### 1. Introduction

This repo is all about what we have done in SDM lab 2 during our semester at UPC. As a BDMA student, we really need to know how to deal with semantics (a.k.a metadata about the data) in case of big data ecosystems. Semantics play a key role when analysing a large corpora of data in today's era. 

In this course, we will explore about the concepts of SDM.
